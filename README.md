Submitted by: **NAME**

Time spent: **#** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)

* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
The websites I used were RapidTables and w3schools. However, I thought the CodePath prework instructions provided all the information needed in great detail.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I encountered during this submission was experiencing an issue where my fourth button would say I lost the game if I clicked it correctly. I looked through my code, specifically the code for the buttons of my game, and couldn’t find anything wrong. What helped me was reaching out to other people on the CodePath Slack and other friends who are familiar with web development. It was extremely helpful and time-efficient when I found out that it worked completely fine for them. I tried my game in a different web browser and it seemed to work. So, I think there was no error in my code just something incompatible with the web browser I was using. Asking for help and taking a second to take a step back saved me a lot of time from being stuck on this issue. Another issue I faced was trying to figure out how to the GitHub repository to the Github desktop and to do the initial push of my code from Glitch. I made sure to rewatch the videos and also look online for other resources to solve this minor issue. Now, I feel a lot more familiar with using GitHub desktop, which was something I wasn’t used to before. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Some questions that I have about web development are geared more towards JavaScript because that is where my interest lies. I think that we briefly touched upon JavaScript on this prework and I was happy to do so since I’ve been wanting to learn it. I find it to be a much more complex language than HTML and CSS, so I would love to learn more about what can be done using JavaScript for web development. It seems as though all complex websites need to be made with JavaScript as well and not only HTML and CSS. Some other questions I have would be are what other attributes can we put into the opening tag for the HTML elements.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Since this is my first time learning and programming with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I would have first taken more time to understand all parts of the code, specifically the JavaScript functions. I would have also liked to create more functions such as picking a different pattern after each time the game is won and also setting a timer for a limited amount of time in between turns. I would have also liked to add additional features, such as making the game more visually appealing. I would have liked to add little comments in speech bubbles on the side that says “Hurry!”, “10 seconds left!”, “Last round!”. I also think adding in a challenge round would make the game more intriguing, the challenge round could consist of the buttons shifting place or rotating after each new pattern. Overall, I would spend more time on the style and appearance of the game to make it more fun and appealing.
